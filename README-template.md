### What I learned

I learnt about Flexbox and Grid, i also learnt how to center a div, text and so on.


```html
<p class="text-title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
```
```css
.text-title {
  font-family: "Outfit", serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll be developing my skills in using the flexbox and grid, i'm not too familiar with that yet. 

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understanding Flexbox and Grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [ChatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me with my CSS styling mostly. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
